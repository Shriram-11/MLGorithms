# MLGorithms: Fun-Learn-Code-Repeat

Welcome to MLGorithms: Fun-Learn-Code-Repeat! This repository is your playground for diving into the world of machine learning algorithms. Here, we believe in making learning fun and iterative. So, roll up your sleeves and dive into the world of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch.

## Usage

To use the MLGorithms repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Shriram-11/MLGorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ```
   cd MLGorithms
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Each algorithm is implemented in its own Python file. You can run each file individually to see the algorithm in action. For example, to run the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm, use the following command:

   ```
   python algorithms/sgd.py
   ```

5. Feel free to explore and experiment with the different algorithms. If you would like to contribute, please create a pull request.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to add an algorithm implementation, please create a pull request.
