# MLGorithms: Fun-Learn-Code-Repeat

Welcome to MLGorithms: Fun-Learn-Code-Repeat! This repository is your playground for diving into the world of machine learning algorithms. Here, we believe in making learning fun and iterative. So, roll up your sleeves and dive into the world of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in its own Python file. You can run each file individually to see the algorithm in action.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to add an algorithm implementation, please create a pull request.
